<h4>1. List all possible plays for the board <i> 5&spades;   4&hearts;   2&diams;   6&clubs;   A&spades;   J&hearts;    K&diams;   5&clubs;   2&spades; </i></h4>


 5&spades; and 6&clubs;, 6&clubs; and 5&clubs;
 
 <h4>2. If the deck is empty and the board has three cards left, must they be J, Q, and K? Why or why not?</h4>
 
 Yes, the fact that the deck is empty means that all of the number cards have been paired and all of the J,Q,K trios have been made except for one.
 
 <h4>3. Does the game involve any strategy? That is, when more than one play is possible, does it matter which one is chosen? Briefly explain your answer.</h4>
 
Yes, it is beneficial to choose a J,Q,K trio over a pair, since that will generate three new cards, instead of two, possibly opening up more combinations.
